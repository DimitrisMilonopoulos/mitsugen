# Shameless fork of [matugen](https://github.com/InioX/matugen)
## Description
[Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) offers a new color system that allows for more flexible and dynamic use of color. The new system includes a wider range of colors, as well as a range of tints and shades that can be used to create subtle variations in color.

## Installation
Assuming you already have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/InioX/matugen && cd matugen
poetry install
```

# Why did I fork this project

- Project Matugen is amazing, but it didn't work for my needs.
- I wanted to use gnome-shell theme
- I needed control over the generated colors 
- Ability to use different templates for dark and light theme instead of the same one
